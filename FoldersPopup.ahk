GetURLsInClipboardLine:
;------------------------------------------------------------
; Adapted from AHK help file: http://ahkscript.org/docs/commands/LoopReadFile.htm
; It's done this particular way because some URLs have other URLs embedded inside them:
StringGetPos, intURLStart1, strURLSearchString, http://
StringGetPos, intURLStart2, strURLSearchString, https://
StringGetPos, intURLStart3, strURLSearchString, www.

; Find the left-most starting position:
intURLStart := intURLStart1 ; Set starting default.
Loop
{
	; It helps performance (at least in a script with many variables) to resolve
	; "intURLStart%A_Index%" only once:
	intArrayElement := intURLStart%A_Index%
	if (intArrayElement = "") ; End of the array has been reached.
		break
	if (intArrayElement = -1) ; This element is disqualified.
		continue
	if (intURLStart = -1)
		intURLStart := intArrayElement
	else ; intURLStart has a valid position in it, so compare it with intArrayElement.
	{
		if (intArrayElement <> -1)
			if (intArrayElement < intURLStart)
				intURLStart := intArrayElement
	}
}

if (intURLStart = -1) ; No URLs exist in strURLSearchString.
	return ; (exit loop)

; Otherwise, extract this strURL:
StringTrimLeft, strURL, strURLSearchString, %intURLStart% ; Omit the beginning/irrelevant part.
Loop, parse, strURL, %A_Tab%%A_Space%<> ; Find the first space, tab, or angle (if any).
{
	strURL := A_LoopField
	break ; i.e. perform only one loop iteration to fetch the first "field".
}
; If the above loop had zero iterations because there were no ending characters found,
; leave the contents of the strURL var untouched.

; If the strURL ends in a double quote, remove it.  For now, StringReplace is used, but
; note that it seems that double quotes can legitimately exist inside URLs, so this
; might damage them:
StringReplace, strURLCleansed, strURL, ",, All


; See if there are any other URLs in this line:
StringLen, intCharactersToOmit, strURL
intCharactersToOmit := intCharactersToOmit + intURLStart
